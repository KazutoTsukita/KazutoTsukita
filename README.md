Hi, my name is Kazuto Tsukita. 
I am a neurologist with an interest in Parkinson's disease.
I am interested in "how to improve the prognosis of Parkinson's disease" and I believe that substantial clues can be obtained from established cohort studies.
If you are interested, please collaborate with me!
